# APG4
Materials used for adopting APG4 as the navigation for Kingdom Plantae.

Following [Lin & Chung, 2017](https://as-botanicalstudies.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40529-017-0206-6), TaiBIF is underway to revise the species navigaion for Kingdom Plantae, hence to adopt APG4. This repository serves as the version control for code and materials produced through the process. We will provide more information/documentation when suitable.
